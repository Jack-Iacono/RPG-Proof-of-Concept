# Turn-Based RPG Tech-Demo
## What is this?
This game is a standard turn-based rpg which I made in order to demonstrate that I am capable of making a game of this genre. 

## Why an RPG?
I made this mostly to tinker with various elements which are only found in RPGs such as enemy randomization and keeping track of stats as well as applying those stats within battles. Most of my games were previously 2D platformers or similar games which focused heavily upon moving the character to accomplish a goal.

# Features and Notes
